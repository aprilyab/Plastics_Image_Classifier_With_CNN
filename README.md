🧠 Intelligent Plastic Classification for Recycling
🏗️ Building a CNN-Powered Model to Automate Plastic Type Detection
📅 Date: 16 July – 22 July 2025

🎯 Business Objective
Plastic waste is one of the most urgent environmental problems of our time. Recycling is a key component of the circular economy, but plastic separation remains expensive and error-prone.

This project develops a deep learning-based image classifier to automate plastic identification — reducing human error and enabling smarter, faster sorting processes in recycling facilities.

💡 Motivation
Different plastic types (PET, HDPE, PP, PS) have different properties and must be recycled separately.

Manual sorting is time-consuming and inconsistent.

Automating classification helps:

Reduce sorting costs

Improve recycling efficiency

Support sustainable production systems (SDG 12)

Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and optionally pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet50), this model identifies plastic types from images and lays the foundation for computer vision-enabled recycling lines.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains images of 4 plastic categories:

PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate)

HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene)

PP (Polypropylene)

PS (Polystyrene)
